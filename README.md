# Fun Numbers Notes

We define 'fun numbers' as numbers whose sum-of-digits is present in the number itself:

For a number, `N`, to be a 'fun number', we first write `C` in base 10 (currently the only supported base):
```
N = a*10^0 + b*10^1 + c*10^2 + ...
```   
Then `N` is a 'fun number' iff:
```
S = a + b + c + ...
```
s.t. the string `S` is contained in the string `N`, e.g. `45` is contained in `123456`.

# NVC Notes

4 step process, applicable to both:

I. Clearly expressing how __I am__ without blaming or criticizing.

II. Empathically receiving how __you are__ without hearing blame or criticism.

#### Observations

I. What I observe (see, hear, remember, imagine, free from my evaluations) that does or does not contribute to my well-being:
```
"When I see/hear..."
```

II. What you observe (see, hear, remember, imagine, free from your evaluations) that does or does not contribute to you well-being:
```
"When you see/hear..."
```

#### Feelings 

I. How I feel (emotion or sensation rather than thought) in relation to what I observe:
``` 
"I feel..."
```
II. How you feel (emotion or sensation rather than thought) in relation to what you observe:
```
"You feel..."
```
#### Needs

I. What I need or value (rather than a preference, or a specific action) that causes my feelings:
```
"...because I need/value..."
```
II. What you need or value (rather than a preference, or a specific action) that causes your feelings:
```
"...because you need/value..."
```

#### Requests
I. Clearly requesting that which would enrich __my__ life without demanding.  The concrete actions I would like taken:
```
"Would you be willing to ...?"
```
II. Empathically receiving that which would enrich __your__ life without hearing any demand:
```
"Would you like to...?"
```
